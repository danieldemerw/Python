tuples are immutable ,meaning we cannot change,add ,or remove items from a tupl once it has been created.
we would have to creat a new tuple with the desired changes.

lists allow duplicates : lists are mutable allows us to add ,remove,or modify elements in an existing list

add elements
append() this adds the element passed into it as a single element to the end of the list
insert()-- >insert an elements at specified postion
extend()--->this adds elements passed into it as separate elements to the end of the list


removing elemets
del() remove or delet an element at specific index
remove()--rist occurence of a specified value from the list
pop()---this remove and returns the element at the specified index
